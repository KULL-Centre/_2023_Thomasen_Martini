martini_v300_pps contains force field files (Gromacs) for Martini v3.0.0 with epsilon in the LJ-potentials between protein beads rescaled by a factor 0.88.

In order to rescale the interactions of protein beads only, we have modified the original Martini 3.0.0 force field files by adding a new set of protein beads with _PRO in the name.
