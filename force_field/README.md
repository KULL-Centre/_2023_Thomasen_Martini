[martini_v300_pps](https://github.com/KULL-Centre/_2023_Thomasen_Martini/tree/main/force_field/martini_v300_pps) contains Gromacs force field files for Martini v3.0.0 with epsilon in the LJ-potentials between protein beads rescaled by a factor λ<sub>PP</sub>=0.88.

In order to rescale the interactions of protein beads only, we have modified the original Martini 3.0.0 force field files by adding a new set of protein beads with _PRO in the bead name.
