martini_v300_modified_protein_ff contains modified Gromacs force field files for Martini v3.0.0. We have added protein-specific beads that are named by amino acid and protein backbone or side-chain, allowing for rescaling interactions for specific amino-acids, backbone or side-chain.
This force field was used as the starting point for rescaling interactions using the script _rescaling_PW_and_PP_martini3_v2.py_, so none of the interactions have been modified in this version of the force field.

**If you are simply looking for Martini 3.0 with protein interactions rescaled by Î»<sup>PP</sup>=0.88, you can find ready-to-use force field files here:** https://github.com/KULL-Centre/_2023_Thomasen_Martini/tree/main/force_field
